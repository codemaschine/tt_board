Introduction
============


.. _what-it-does:

What does it do?
----------------

This is a forum and commenting system in list and tree view.
It is the oldest forum/message board extension in TYPO3. It is not aimed at competing with those board products which features a lot community like features with user profiles. However a front end user login may be used to limit read/write access by simply access-restricting the very board elements and pages used for display and submission of data. Use this extension in combination with a front end user registration extension.
